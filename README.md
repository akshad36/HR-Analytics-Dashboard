HR analytics, also referred to as people analytics, workforce analytics, or talent analytics, involves gathering together, analyzing, and reporting HR data. It is the collection and application of talent data to improve critical talent and business outcomes. It enables your organization to measure the impact of a range of HR metrics on overall business performance and make decisions based on data. They are primarily responsible for interpreting and analyzing vast datasets.
In this Power BI Dashboard, we used data from HR analytics to help an organization improve employee performance and retention (reduce attrition) by creating an HR Analytics Dashboard.
